\section{Model}

% a precise description of your approach

Baseline:
    old fashioned seq2seq, no genre information

Bos_genre:
    instead of starting decoder sequence with <bos> use <genre>
    pros:
        easy to implement
        cheap: no additional parameters are introduced
            (except to learn tag embeddings)
    cons:
        long range dependency is probably difficult
            (although we probably expect answers to be short...)

Concat_one_hot:
    append a one hot encoding of the genre to the word embedding
    pros:
        genre should effect each step of the model
        (e.g. sentence won't forget the genre as it grows,
            whereas in bos_genre it could).
    cons:
        genres are independent of each other

Concat_embedding:
    embed genre before concatenating to the word embeddings
    pros:
        ability to model genre information
    cons:
        genre information is compressed further
        we likely will already have a hard time modelling it
